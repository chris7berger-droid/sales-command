## 2026-05-10 — PR #20 (H5) notes

Audit terminal greenlit PR #20 after two scratch verifications: the original SQL smoke (16/16 PASS on scratch `lvbdsfyppaogaezvqmrg`, deleted post-test) and the rollback round-trip (R1–R9 PASS on scratch `nqanzszlbbjkercgwrtl`, deleted post-test). Two audit notes carried into deploy:

- **L1.** `mark_proposal_signed` 5-arg builds its `p_pdf_url` allow-list regex by string-concatenating `v_proposal_id` into the pattern. Low risk because every existing and trigger-generated proposal id is a UUID (no regex metacharacters). Optional follow-up: switch to a literal substring check after the regex prefix matches. Not a deploy blocker.
- **L2.** `ProposalPDFModal.handleSend` now writes `proposals.status='Sent'` + refreshes `signing_token_expires_at` BEFORE invoking `send-proposal`. If Resend fails after the UPDATE, the proposal is flagged Sent with a refreshed expiry but no email was delivered — the rep retries. Accepted trade-off in exchange for the invariant "the link the customer holds is never expired-before-receipt."

Deploy outcome (2026-05-11 02:09 UTC):
- Migration A applied clean (`Finished supabase db push`).
- Q-POST-APPLY 1–6 green on prod (6/6). Backfill sanity: 0 unbacked-token rows, 0 Sold-unconsumed rows.
- `proposal-signed` deployed.
- PostgREST cache reloaded (5-arg RPC resolves to HTTP 400 INVALID_TOKEN, not PGRST202).
- Prod smoke P3 + P4 PASS on TEST customer "10085 - TEST" (proposal id `6e6b120b-e960-4791-b87e-2e4f3a7a8349`):
  - P3 — existing Sold proposal revisit renders Accepted ✓
  - P4 send → `signing_token_expires_at = 2026-08-09 02:09:51` (89d 23h 58m out) ✓
  - P4 sign → atomic state: `status=Sold`, `approved_at`, `signing_token_consumed_at`, `proposal_signatures.signed_at` all identical `02:13:02.712165+00`; `call_log.stage=Sold`; `ip_address=76.235.216.194` (real client IP captured server-side via `x-forwarded-for`, NOT from React body); `pdf_url` non-null + passed Supabase regex ✓
  - P4 revisit → Accepted screen rendered fresh from `get_public_proposal_view` (permissive on `consumed_at`) ✓
  - P4 stale-tab — edge fn returned HTTP 409 `{"error":"ALREADY_SIGNED"}` for the consumed token re-attempt. UI's `fnError.context?.json?.()` parse path (QBLinkModal pattern at `src/components/QBLinkModal.jsx:29`) routes that to silent `setSigned(true)` + `qbBlocked=true` (prevents qb-create-job double-fire). HTTP contract verified directly via curl; UI handling follows from existing tested parse pattern.

O3 timer: started 2026-05-11 02:09 UTC. Earliest Migration B start: 2026-05-13 02:10 UTC. Before applying Migration B, query `pg_stat_statements` (or Supabase function/RPC logs) for traffic to the 1-arg `mark_proposal_signed` form since 2026-05-11; require zero hits before drop.

## 2026-05-10 — PR #19 smoke plan notes

Step 3a executed; Steps 3b and 3c not executed.

Step 3a — `qb-search-customers` invoked from the live app via the
Link-to-Existing flow on a real job (CallLogDetail → Connect to
QuickBooks → Link to Existing → search "kal"). Returned a populated
result list (KalB Industries Of Nevada parent + multiple
sub-customers). The modal was cancelled without selecting a result.

What 3a proves:
- The deployed `qb-search-customers` function loads.
- `authenticateCaller` wiring (introduced PR #19) accepts a real user
  session and rejects nothing it shouldn't.
- `getQBToken(sb, tenantId)` resolves for the current tenant.
- Token-refresh persistence does not false-fail (the request would
  have errored if the refresh write missed its row).

What 3a does NOT prove:
- 3a is deploy-health, not security validation.
- 3a may have refreshed QB tokens in `qb_connection` (side effect of
  `getQBToken` when the access token is near expiry) — this is an
  expected and intended side effect, not a violation of "read-only".
- 3a does not prove cross-tenant isolation. A second tenant would be
  required to confirm `qb_connection.tenant_id` scoping actually
  rejects another tenant's caller. With the app at single tenant,
  this remains untested.
- 3a does not prove RLS behavior across tenants for any of the
  PR #19 surface (`qb-create-job`, `qb-link-customer`,
  `send-pay-app`).
- 3a does not exercise the full C9 fix (recipient allowlist,
  attachment-URL allowlist, server-derived sender, DB-only PDF
  URLs, payApp ↔ invoice tenant assertions, payApp.invoice_id ===
  invoiceId).

Steps 3b and 3c — not executed. Both require a safe internal test
fixture (test customer + test pay-app + test invoice with a non-real
recipient destination). No such fixture exists at single tenant.
Re-run when a fixture is available, or when the second tenant onboards
under F7 and naturally creates one.

Hard limits respected this session:
- No live customer emails sent.
- No mutations to real billing, pay-app, invoice, customer, or
  call_log rows.
- No QB link/create against live data (no `qb-create-job`,
  no `qb-link-customer` mutating writes).
- No product code changes.
- No deploys.

Pattern tag rationale (`protocol-theater`): the original v104 smoke
plan named three steps. Two of the three are unrunnable at single
tenant without building scaffolding the audit would also need to
validate. Booking the deferral keeps the gap visible instead of
implying "smoke = security verified."
