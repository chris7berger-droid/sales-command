# Plan — Invoice Email Attachments (persisted, historical)

_Authored 2026-07-02. Planning terminal (T1). Grounded in a full read of
`send-invoice/index.ts`, `send-pay-app/index.ts`, `Invoices.jsx` send view +
`handleSend` + `InvoiceDetail`, `PayAppDetailModal.jsx` upload handlers,
`_shared/recipientAllowlist.ts`, and the `invoice_recipients` migration._

**Status: Round-2 audit folded in (2026-07-02) — BUILD-READY (T3).** Plateau
broken by bounding attachments at upload (Round-2 Option 1). See
`## Audit Amendments (post-Round-2)`. Send back only if the edge-fn bounds or the
modal-state wiring need a Round-3 check.

Confidence tags per section: **[LOCKED]** = user-ratified intent · **[DERIVED]**
= inferred from code, verify in audit · **[DESIGN-OPEN]** = needs a decision.

## §0 Baseline (observed current state)

- **Regular invoice send has NO attachment capability.** `send-invoice/index.ts`
  builds an HTML-only Resend email (`sendEmail`, `:354-362`) — payload is
  `{ from, to, subject, html }`, no `attachments` field. Customer gets a Stripe
  pay link + a "View Full Invoice / Print PDF" hyperlink (`:315`); the invoice
  PDF is never attached.
- **The pattern we need already exists one folder over.** `send-pay-app/index.ts`
  base64-encodes PDFs from storage (`arrayBufferToBase64`, `:56`) and passes a
  Resend `attachments: [...]` array (`:357-374`), gated by an SSRF storage
  allowlist (`isAllowedStorageUrl`, `:18-29`). It already attaches a **release
  waiver** (`release_waiver_url`). This task lifts that mechanism into the regular
  invoice send and generalizes it to N persisted attachments.
- **Upload UI pattern exists.** `PayAppDetailModal.handleUploadWaiver` (`:196-218`)
  uploads to `job-attachments` (sanitized filename), `getPublicUrl`, persists the
  URL to a column. We copy this shape.
- **Extract precedent exists.** `_shared/recipientAllowlist.ts` was extracted
  (T5 #9) so both send fns share one implementation. The attachment helpers get
  the same treatment (Round-1 Finding D).
- **`InvoiceDetail` already owns child-collection state and passes it as a prop.**
  `recipients` is loaded in `InvoiceDetail` and passed to `InvoicePDFModal`
  (`Invoices.jsx:2397`); the modal's `loadContact` only self-fetches when the prop
  is absent (`:662`). Attachments mirror this (Round-1 Findings B/C).
- **Send handler already re-derives sensitive data server-side.** `handleSend`
  (`:688-749`) sends only display fields; `send-invoice` loads recipients/amount
  from the DB (audit C9 / B36). Attachments follow the same rule.

---

## 1. Problem / intent [LOCKED]

Chris needs to attach a **release waiver** (and, generally, one or more arbitrary
documents) to a regular invoice email, **persisted** so that opening an invoice
historically shows exactly what documents went out with it. One invoice may carry
**multiple** attachments at once — a collection (table), not a single column.

Scenario: a partial invoice sent with a waiver, then the remaining-billing invoice
sent later with its own waiver. Each is a **separate `invoices` row**, so each
carries its own attachment set — no cross-invoice coupling.

---

## 2. The model to mirror (`send-pay-app`) [DERIVED]

| Concern | `send-pay-app` does | This plan does |
|---|---|---|
| Attachment source | fixed columns on rows | rows in new `invoice_attachments` table |
| SSRF defense | `isAllowedStorageUrl` (`:18-29`) | shared helper, `job-attachments` bucket, **path-pinned to `invoice-attachments/${invoiceId}/`** |
| Encode | `arrayBufferToBase64` (`:56`) | same helper (extracted to `_shared`) |
| Resend field | `attachments: [...]` (`:357-374`) | same, built ONCE from N rows |
| Client trust | URLs re-derived from DB, body ignored | same — client passes nothing |
| Failure mode | invoice PDF required; extras 400 on bad URL | **fail-open**: every attachment non-fatal → `warnings[]` (Option 1, ratified) |

---

## 3. Invoice side today [DERIVED]

- `handleSend` (`:688-749`) → `functions.invoke("send-invoice", { body })` with
  display fields only.
- Send view UI: `:979-1034` (`view === "send"`) — Main / Viewers / Amount panels,
  then "Send Invoice with Pay Link" (`:1028`, disabled on
  `sending || noMainBlock || mainMissingEmail`).
- `send-invoice`: creates the Stripe link (`:215-268`), persists it (`:274-278`),
  then sends MAIN (fatal) + each VIEWER (non-fatal → `warnings[]`) via
  `sendEmail(to, html)` (`:354-362`).

---

## 4. Proposed change

### Ratified design call — Round 1: fail-open, pre-Stripe attachment handling [LOCKED]

Attachments are handled **fail-open** and **before** the Stripe payment link is
created. No attachment problem (bad URL, unfetchable file, oversize) may block the
invoice+pay-link email or leak past into a Stripe side effect — a failed waiver
becomes a `warnings[]` entry, never a hard error. Ratified 2026-07-02 (Round-1
Findings A + D).

### Ratified design call — Round 2: bound attachments AT UPLOAD [LOCKED]

**Max 3 attachments per invoice, each ≤ 10 MB, rejected client-side before
`storage.upload` (§4.2).** This breaks the two-round `copied-mechanism-misfit`
plateau: bounding at the source removes the reason the copied send-fn loop needed
progressive hardening. The edge-fn size handling (§4.4) becomes a cheap **secondary**
guard on already-bounded input, not the primary defense. Ratified 2026-07-02
(Round-2 plateau analysis). With this taken, Round 2 is the last round.

### 4.1 DB — new `invoice_attachments` table [LOCKED shape, DERIVED columns]

Authored in **`command-suite-db`** (SC no longer owns migrations — CLAUDE.md).
This section is the **spec**; the file is created + pushed there at build. Modeled
on `20260625120000_invoice_recipients.sql`.

```sql
-- Invoice Attachments — documents emailed with an invoice, persisted so an
-- invoice's history shows exactly what went out with it. One invoice may have
-- many. RLS: standard 4-policy tenant pattern. No anon policy — the public
-- invoice page does not list attachments (§6).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.invoice_attachments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  invoice_id text NOT NULL
    REFERENCES public.invoices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_url text NOT NULL,          -- public URL in job-attachments bucket
  storage_path text NOT NULL,      -- object path for precise delete (Finding F)
  file_name text NOT NULL,         -- original (sanitized) filename
  label text,                      -- e.g. 'Release Waiver' (freeform; defaults to file_name)
  content_type text,               -- from the upload (best-effort)
  size_bytes bigint,               -- DISPLAY ONLY — the send cap uses FETCHED bytes (Finding G/I, §4.4)
  created_by uuid,                 -- forced to auth.uid() by BEFORE INSERT trigger below (R2 Finding D)
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  tenant_id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT get_user_tenant_id()
    REFERENCES public.tenant_config(id)
);
-- created_by: a column DEFAULT is client-overridable; force it authoritatively.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.set_invoice_attachment_created_by()
  RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = '' AS $$
BEGIN NEW.created_by := auth.uid(); RETURN NEW; END $$;
CREATE TRIGGER trg_invoice_attachments_created_by
  BEFORE INSERT ON public.invoice_attachments
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.set_invoice_attachment_created_by();
-- NOTE (R2 Finding G/I): the earlier UNIQUE(invoice_id, file_url) was DROPPED —
-- file_url carries crypto.randomUUID() entropy, so it can never collide; the
-- constraint was inert. No natural dup key exists for a random-path upload.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoice_attachments_invoice_id
  ON public.invoice_attachments(invoice_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoice_attachments_tenant_id
  ON public.invoice_attachments(tenant_id);
ALTER TABLE public.invoice_attachments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- 4 policies (select/insert/update/delete) TO authenticated,
-- USING/WITH CHECK (tenant_id = get_user_tenant_id()) — copy verbatim from
-- invoice_recipients migration.
```

**Storage:** reuse the **`job-attachments`** public bucket (already has a DELETE
policy, migration `20260420120000`). Path carries **random entropy** so a public
URL is not enumerable (Round-1 Finding E):

```
invoice-attachments/{invoice_id}/{crypto.randomUUID()}-{cleanName}
```

`cleanName = file.name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, "_")` (CLAUDE.md storage rule).
The `{invoiceId}/` segment is REQUIRED and is enforced again in the edge-fn
allowlist prefix (§4.4). **Ratified: public bucket + unguessable random path**
(matches the existing waiver model, no signing needed on fetch/download).
_[Documented stronger alternative, not chosen for v1: private bucket + signed URLs
— would add signing to both the edge-fn fetch and the historical download.]_

### 4.2 UI — Attachments panel in the send view (`Invoices.jsx`) [LOCKED behavior]

Add an **Attachments** panel inside `view === "send"` (after Amount `:1021-1024`,
before the send button `:1028`). Mirrors `PayAppDetailModal` UX.

- **Upload bounds — client-side, BEFORE `storage.upload` (R2 Option 1) [LOCKED]:**
  reject the pick if it would exceed **3 attachments** on this invoice, or if the
  file is **> 10 MB**. Surface a plain inline message ("Up to 3 files, 10 MB each")
  and never call `storage.upload`/`insert` for a rejected file. These are the
  authoritative bounds; §4.4's byte cap is a secondary guard.
- **Add:** hidden `<input type="file" accept="application/pdf,.docx,.xlsx,.xls,image/*">`
  behind a styled label (copy `PayAppDetailModal:574-612`). On pick (after the
  bounds check): set `uploading` → sanitize name → build path with
  `crypto.randomUUID()` → `storage.from("job-attachments").upload(path, file, { contentType })`
  → `getPublicUrl` → `insert` into `invoice_attachments`
  `{ invoice_id, file_url, storage_path: path, file_name, label, content_type, size_bytes }`
  (`tenant_id`/`created_at` default; `created_by` forced by trigger §4.1) →
  `reloadAttachments()` → clear `uploading`.
- **Modal state wiring (R2 Finding C) [LOCKED]:** `InvoicePDFModal` holds its own
  `const [attachments, setAttachments] = useState([])` **seeded from the prop**,
  plus a `reloadAttachments()` that re-selects for `invoice.id`, plus an
  `onAttachmentsChanged` callback it fires after add/remove so `InvoiceDetail`
  re-fetches its copy. Mirror `reloadRecipients` (`Invoices.jsx:1126`) and the way
  recipient mutations call it (`:1180`, `:1209`, `:1225`).
- **Send-button gate (R1 Finding B):** add `uploading` to the disable at `:1028` —
  `disabled={sending || noMainBlock || mainMissingEmail || uploading}`.
- **Label:** defaults to the filename; quick-pick chips (**Release Waiver**,
  **Lien Release**) set the label in one tap; freeform edit allowed.
  _[DESIGN-OPEN: preset list — §7 #A.]_
- **Remove — order-of-ops + failure surface (R2 Findings D + F) [LOCKED]:**
  **row-first, then storage.** Delete the `invoice_attachments` row (by `id`), and
  only on success call `storage.remove([storage_path])` (path taken from the
  **`storage_path`** column, never re-parsed from `file_url`).
  - Row delete fails → **abort with an inline error; the file is untouched**
    (consistent, retry-able). Nothing is orphaned.
  - Row delete succeeds, `storage.remove` fails/no-ops → the row (and its download
    link) is already gone from the UI, so the user sees a correct list; log +
    non-blocking warning; the leaked object is reclaimed by the storage-orphan
    sweep tracked in **S10** (bucket-wide DELETE hardening). Rationale: a dangling
    *row* (broken link the user sees) is worse than an orphaned *file* (invisible,
    bounded by the 3-file cap + random path).
  - ⚠️ `storage.remove` silently returns `[]` without a DELETE policy —
    `job-attachments` HAS one; don't trust the empty array (memory:
    storage-remove-silent-noop). This is exactly why the row is the source of truth
    and goes first.
- Panel lists current attachments (label · filename · remove ✕).

### 4.3 Send handler (`handleSend`, `:688-749`) [LOCKED]

**No change to the request body.** Attachments are NOT passed to the edge fn —
`send-invoice` re-derives them from `invoice_attachments` by `invoice_id`
(server-trust rule, audit C9). The client cannot inject an outbound attachment URL.

### 4.4 Edge fn `send-invoice/index.ts` [LOCKED]

**Ordering (R1 Finding A):** all attachment work happens **immediately after the
invoice tenant gate (`:53-55`) and BEFORE Stripe link creation (`:237`)**. If a
future edit throws in this block it must be caught locally; nothing here may abort
the send or run after the Stripe link is minted.

**Declaration hoist — BUILD-BREAKING if missed (R2 regression) [LOCKED]:** the
attachment block runs before `:237`, but `const warnings: string[] = []` is
currently declared at **`:364`** and there is no `attachmentsPayload` yet. **Hoist
both `warnings` and `attachmentsPayload` to just after the tenant gate (`~:55`),
above the attachment block, and DELETE the existing `:364` `warnings`
re-declaration** — leaving both would shadow/`const`-redeclare and fail the build.
The viewer loop and sender-notification block already reference `warnings`; they
now read the hoisted one.

1. **Shared helpers (Finding D — extract NOW):** create
   `supabase/functions/_shared/attachments.ts` exporting `isAllowedStorageUrl`
   and `arrayBufferToBase64` (lifted from `send-pay-app`; precedent
   `_shared/recipientAllowlist.ts`). `send-invoice` imports both.
   - `ALLOWED_STORAGE_BUCKETS = ["job-attachments"]` **only** (drop
     `signed-proposals` — invoice attachments never live there; Round-1 Finding D).
   - Tighten the allowlist to require the path prefix
     `/storage/v1/object/public/job-attachments/invoice-attachments/${invoiceId}/`
     — so even a valid-bucket URL from another invoice/tenant is rejected.
   - _(send-pay-app keeps its own copy this loop — not touched, §6. Migrating it
     onto the shared helper is a filed follow-up.)_
2. **Load rows (tenant-scoped, once, capped, non-throwing) (R2 Regression + A):**
   after the hoist, `select("file_url, file_name, label")` from
   `invoice_attachments`
   `.eq("invoice_id", invoiceId).eq("tenant_id", invoice.tenant_id).limit(3)`
   (service role bypasses RLS → explicit tenant filter mandatory, matches
   recipients `:109-113`; `.limit(3)` mirrors the upload bound). **A load error
   must NOT throw** — `if (loadErr) { warnings.push("Attachments couldn't be
   loaded"); attachmentRows = []; }` and proceed to the pay-link send.
3. **Validate + fetch + encode ONCE, each row isolated, size-guarded BEFORE fetch
   (R2 Regression + A + B):**
   ```
   let totalBytes = 0; const CAP = 35 * 1024 * 1024; const PER = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
   for (const row of (attachmentRows || [])) {          // null-safe (R2 regression)
     try {
       if (!isAllowedStorageUrl(row.file_url, invoiceId)) { warnings.push(...); continue; }
       if (totalBytes >= CAP) { warnings.push(`${row.file_name} — skipped, size cap`); continue; }  // guard BEFORE fetch
       const res = await fetch(row.file_url);
       if (!res.ok) { warnings.push(...); continue; }
       const len = Number(res.headers.get("content-length") || 0);   // pre-check BEFORE arrayBuffer
       if (len > PER || totalBytes + len > CAP) { warnings.push(`${row.file_name} — skipped, too large`); continue; }
       const buf = await res.arrayBuffer();
       if (totalBytes + buf.byteLength > CAP) { warnings.push(`${row.file_name} — skipped, size cap`); continue; }  // final guard (len can lie/absent)
       totalBytes += buf.byteLength;
       attachmentsPayload.push({ filename: row.file_name, content: arrayBufferToBase64(buf) });
     } catch (e) { warnings.push(`${row.file_name} — ${e.message}`); continue; }
   }
   ```
   - **`for (const row of (attachmentRows || []))`** — never iterate `null`.
   - **Per-row `try/catch` → `warnings.push` + `continue`.** No attachment error —
     including the load error above — ever throws out of this block or reaches
     `sendEmail`.
   - **Size guarded BEFORE buffering:** skip on the running total *before* fetch,
     and on `content-length` *before* `arrayBuffer()`, so an oversize file is never
     read into memory (defense against a bounded-at-upload cap being bypassed).
     Bounds are authoritative at upload (§4.2); this is the secondary guard.
   - `attachmentsPayload` (hoisted) is built **exactly once** and reused for MAIN +
     every viewer — no per-recipient re-fetch.
4. **Attach to sends:** extend `sendEmail(to, html)` → `sendEmail(to, html, attachments)`
   and pass `attachmentsPayload` to the MAIN send (`:368`) and each VIEWER send
   (`:394`). **Viewers get the documents too** (ratified — a "copy for your
   records" should include the waiver).
5. **Sender notification (`:407-442`):** append the attachment names, escaped via
   the existing `esc` (`:301`).

### 4.5 Historical view (`InvoiceDetail` + detail modal) [LOCKED]

Load attachments **in `InvoiceDetail`'s own effect keyed on `inv.id`**, into its
own `attachments` state, and pass them to `InvoicePDFModal` as a **prop** — mirror
`recipients` at `Invoices.jsx:2397` (Round-1 Findings B/C). **Do NOT** hang the
fetch off the modal's `loadContact` effect, which is keyed on `proposal_id` and
would miss/re-fetch incorrectly.

**Render site (R2 Finding C):** add the read-only attachment list to the
`InvoiceDetail` detail view **directly below the Recipients section render at
`Invoices.jsx:2152`** (`{/* Recipients … */}`), so the two invoice child
collections sit together. Opening any invoice then shows the documents that went
with it, each a download link.

**Safe href (R2 Finding E) [LOCKED]:** before rendering `<a href={file_url}>`,
validate `file_url.startsWith(`${SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/job-attachments/`)`;
if it doesn't, render plain text (no anchor). Blocks a `javascript:`/`data:` scheme
from a tampered row reaching an anchor href. Also add `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

Attachments are **invoice-scoped, not send-event-scoped** (§7 #D).

---

## 5. Files to touch

**`command-suite-db`** (migration authored + pushed here, at build):
- `supabase/migrations/<ts>_invoice_attachments.sql` — table (incl. `storage_path`,
  `created_by` set by a BEFORE INSERT trigger; no UNIQUE — inert on random paths)
  + 2 indexes + 4 RLS policies + the `created_by` trigger/function.

**`sales-command`**:
- `supabase/functions/_shared/attachments.ts` — **NEW.** `isAllowedStorageUrl`
  (bucket + `invoice-attachments/${invoiceId}/` prefix) + `arrayBufferToBase64`.
- `supabase/functions/send-invoice/index.ts` — import shared helpers; load
  `invoice_attachments`; validate/fetch/encode once, fail-open, pre-Stripe, size
  cap; attach to main + viewers; list in sender notification (§4.4).
- `src/pages/Invoices.jsx` — send-view Attachments panel + upload/remove handlers +
  `uploading` gate (§4.2); `InvoiceDetail` load-effect + `attachments` prop +
  historical list in detail view (§4.5).
- `docs/BACKLOG.md` — F39 row (filed) + adjacent K–N rows (see Amendments).

**Not touched (kept scoped):** `send-pay-app`, `PayAppDetailModal`,
`PublicInvoicePage`, QB sync, Stripe path.

---

## 6. Out of scope / deferred [DERIVED]

- **Public invoice page** does not list attachments (no anon RLS policy).
- **Send-event granularity** (which attachment went in send #1 vs a re-send) — v1
  treats attachments as the invoice's current document set (§7 #D).
- **Migrate `send-pay-app` onto `_shared/attachments.ts`** — filed follow-up; not
  touched this loop to stay scoped.
- **F12 "PandaDoc PDF attachment"** (BACKLOG) is an unrelated integration.

---

## 7. Risks / open questions (remaining after Round 2)

- **#A [DESIGN-OPEN] Preset label chips** — exact list (Release Waiver, Lien
  Release, …). Cosmetic; not a blocker; decide at build.
- **#D Re-send fidelity** — attachments are invoice-scoped, so adding a doc after a
  first send makes history reflect the *current* set, not literally what email #1
  carried. **Accepted for v1** (no compliance need surfaced across two rounds).
- **#XSS** — `label`/`file_name` are user input; escape at every HTML sink (sender
  notification via `esc`; React auto-escapes the detail list). Build-time check.

_Resolved from Round 1:_ ~~fail-open vs hard-fail~~ (Option 1) · ~~viewers get
docs~~ (yes) · ~~size limit~~ (bounded at upload + 35 MB fetch cap) · ~~copy vs
extract~~ (`_shared/attachments.ts`) · ~~"guessable-by-token" bucket~~
(random-entropy path).

_Resolved from Round 2:_ ~~unbounded attachment count/size~~ (max 3 × ≤10 MB at
upload) · ~~load-error/null could throw~~ (non-throwing, null-safe, `.limit(3)`) ·
~~`warnings`/`attachmentsPayload` build break~~ (hoisted, `:364` re-decl removed) ·
~~buffer-then-skip~~ (size guard before fetch + content-length pre-check) ·
~~client-settable `created_by`~~ (trigger) · ~~inert UNIQUE~~ (dropped) ·
~~unspecified remove order~~ (row-first + failure surface, §4.2) · ~~unsafe
`<a href>`~~ (public-prefix validation, §4.5) · ~~modal-state wiring~~
(`reloadAttachments` + `onAttachmentsChanged`, §4.2).

---

## 8. Build / deploy discipline

- **Migration:** author on its own branch in `command-suite-db`; `npm run db:push`
  there (safety + collision guards). **Sequence after any in-flight Schedule
  Command migration** — don't push while sch-command's `db:push` is mid-flight;
  second one rebases on `main` first (single shared ledger).
- **Edge fn:** `supabase functions deploy send-invoice --no-verify-jwt` (memory).
  CORS unchanged (`_shared/cors.ts`). New `_shared/attachments.ts` ships with it.
- **Post-deploy smoke (memory):** TEST-named job → attach a waiver → send to a TEST
  recipient → confirm (a) email arrives with the attachment, (b)
  `invoice_attachments` row exists, (c) historical list renders it, (d) remove
  actually deletes the file, (e) an oversize/garbage-URL row is skipped with a
  warning and the pay-link email still sends.
- **Gates:** `/buildvsplan` → `/code-review` → `/security-review` (storage
  allowlist, tenant scoping, email egress, RLS all touched — required).

---

## Audit Amendments (post-Round-1)

Round-1 audit (3 agents) on `feat/invoice-email-attachments @ c0764d2`: 6 caused-by
findings (2H / 4M), 4 adjacent. Pattern: **copied-mechanism-misfit** (the
`send-pay-app` mechanism was lifted without adapting to invoice-flow ordering,
trust, and lifecycle differences). Outcome: accepted-pending-changes.

**Design call ratified:** **Option 1 — fail-open, pre-Stripe attachment handling.**

### Findings folded into the plan
- **A (High) — attachment failure could abort the send / run post-Stripe.** →
  §4.4 moved all attachment work before Stripe link creation; per-row try/catch →
  `warnings` + continue; payload built once; no throw reaches `sendEmail`.
- **B (High) — invoice sendable mid-upload.** → §4.2 adds `uploading` to the
  send-button disable at `:1028`.
- **C (Med) — attachment fetch hung off the wrong effect / re-fetched per
  recipient.** → §4.5 loads in `InvoiceDetail` keyed on `inv.id` + prop (mirror
  recipients `:2397`); §4.4 fetches/encodes once.
- **D (Med) — helper duplicated + bucket too broad.** → §4.4 extracts
  `_shared/attachments.ts`; `ALLOWED_STORAGE_BUCKETS = ["job-attachments"]` with
  path pinned to `invoice-attachments/${invoiceId}/`.
- **E (Med) — public bucket URL enumerable.** → §4.1 random-entropy path
  (`crypto.randomUUID()`); §7 #7 text corrected.
- **F (Med) — remove re-parsed the URL / didn't verify.** → §4.1 adds
  `storage_path`; §4.2 removes via it, deletes storage then row, verifies both.
- **G/I (Low, cheap — folded) —** §4.1: `created_by DEFAULT auth.uid()`,
  `UNIQUE(invoice_id, file_url)`, size for the cap from fetched bytes not the
  client column.

### Adjacent (filed to BACKLOG, NOT fixed this loop) — Findings K–N
> Round-1 named K–N as adjacent but shipped no descriptions, so nothing was
> fabricated. Round 2 supplied text for the storage-security adjacents
> (**bucket-wide DELETE** on `job-attachments`; **sharper `storage_path` deletion
> vector**) — now filed as **S10** (there was no pre-existing "row L"; the only
> `L`-row is the unrelated `L15`). Any remaining K/M/N still lack text.

## Audit Amendments (post-Round-2)

Round-2 audit (3 agents) on `feat/invoice-email-attachments @ fe388e6`: 1 Med
**regression** + 6 caused-by (0H/3M/3L) + 1 adjacent. Trend vs R1: severity DOWN
(2H→0H), count FLAT (6→6) → **plateau**; theme unchanged (`copied-mechanism-misfit`).
Scope analysis: the copied send-fn mechanism is load-bearing; the fix is to remove
the reason it needed hardening.

**Design call ratified: Round-2 Option 1 — bound attachments AT UPLOAD** (max 3 ×
≤10 MB, client-side). This breaks the plateau; Round 2 is the last round.

### Findings folded into the plan
- **Regression (Med) — `warnings`/`attachmentsPayload` used before declaration once
  the block moved pre-Stripe → build break.** → §4.4 hoist both above `~:55`,
  delete the `:364` re-declaration; null-safe loop.
- **A (Med) — load could throw / unbounded rows.** → §4.4 non-throwing load,
  `.limit(3)`.
- **B (Med) — buffer-then-skip read oversize files into memory.** → §4.4 guard the
  running total before fetch + `content-length` pre-check before `arrayBuffer()`.
- **C (Med) — modal-owned state / render site unnamed.** → §4.2 modal `useState`
  seeded from prop + `reloadAttachments()` + `onAttachmentsChanged` (mirror
  `reloadRecipients :1126`); §4.5 render at `:2152` (mirror recipients).
- **D (Low) — `created_by` DEFAULT client-overridable; UNIQUE inert.** → §4.1
  BEFORE INSERT trigger forces `auth.uid()`; UNIQUE dropped.
- **E (Low) — `<a href>` scheme not validated.** → §4.5 public-prefix check +
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- **F (Low) — remove order-of-ops unspecified.** → §4.2 row-first + explicit
  failure surface.

### Adjacent (filed to BACKLOG as **S10**, NOT fixed this loop)
Bucket-wide DELETE policy on `job-attachments` (any authenticated user can delete
any tenant's object) + the `storage_path` deletion vector it enables (a
client-set `storage_path` pointing at another tenant's object). Pre-existing infra;
tenant/path-scoped storage policies are a separate hardening task.

## Audit manifest

_Seed manifest for `/runaudit`. Regenerate via `/auditcriteria` before a round._

### Bottom line (plain English)
Two rounds folded; plateau broken by bounding attachments at upload (3 × ≤10 MB).
**Build-ready.** Only re-audit (Round 3) is needed if the edge-fn bounds
(hoist/regression, size-guard-before-fetch, `.limit(3)`, non-throwing load) or the
modal-state wiring (`reloadAttachments`/`onAttachmentsChanged`) want a
verification pass — otherwise integrate at T3.

### Round
Post-Round 2 → build-ready. R1 = 6 caused-by (2H/4M); R2 = 1 regression + 6
caused-by (0H/3M/3L), plateau; theme `copied-mechanism-misfit` both rounds, broken
by Round-2 Option 1 (bound at upload).

### Deployment context
Prod money path (customer invoices). Shared Supabase ledger with a concurrent
Schedule build — migration sequenced (§8).

### Surface
`invoice_attachments` migration spec (§4.1); `_shared/attachments.ts` +
`send-invoice/index.ts` (§4.4); `Invoices.jsx` send-view + `InvoiceDetail` (§4.2,
§4.5).

### Layers touched
DB (new table + RLS), storage (job-attachments, entropy path), edge fn (email
egress + external fetch + size cap), React UI.

### New mechanisms introduced
First N-row attachment collection for invoices; first time `send-invoice` fetches
external URLs + emits Resend attachments; first `_shared/attachments.ts`.

### Cross-system reach
Resend (email), Supabase Storage (fetch + delete), shared migration ledger.

### Irreversibility
Sends real customer email; migration on shared prod ledger; deletes storage files.

### Known weak points
Edge-fn ordering/isolation correctness (did every path stay fail-open + pre-Stripe);
allowlist prefix pinning (cross-invoice/cross-tenant URL rejection); storage-delete
verify; XSS at label/filename sinks; re-send fidelity (§7 #D).

### Suggested attack angles
1. Tenant isolation + SSRF: can a crafted `file_url` or cross-tenant/cross-invoice
   `invoice_attachments` row pass the pinned prefix and reach the fetch/attach path?
2. Fail-open integrity: can any attachment error (throw, oversize, 404, non-PDF)
   abort the pay-link email, run after the Stripe link, or leak a partial send?

### Suggested agent count: 3
DB/RLS · edge-fn security (SSRF/tenant/egress/ordering) · UI+correctness.

## Post-Build Design Change (2026-07-06) — attachment management moved to the detail page

**Supersedes §4.2's placement (upload panel in the send view).** During smoke
prep, the upload UI's home was reconsidered: the send flow is a
**review/approve/launch** surface — you don't *create or edit* content there,
you confirm it and let it fly. Attachments are content built onto the invoice,
so they belong where everything else on the invoice is managed. Ratified by
Chris 2026-07-02.

- **Management (add / label / remove)** now lives in an **Attachments section on
  `InvoiceDetail`, directly below Recipients** — same surface class, gated the
  same way (`!inv.voided_at && !linkedPayApp`). All the handlers + bounds state
  moved from `InvoicePDFModal` to `InvoiceDetail`.
- **Send view (`InvoicePDFModal`)** now renders a **read-only summary card**
  ("Attachments (N)" + labels) for review only — no upload/remove, no `uploading`
  gate on the send button. `attachments` is passed in read-only; the modal no
  longer owns attachment state or fires `onAttachmentsChanged`.
- **Rationale:** mirrors Recipients exactly (managed on the detail page, shown
  read-only in the send flow) — the consistency users expect. Everything else
  (fail-open edge fn, SSRF triple-pin, size caps, RLS, verify-after-delete,
  filename de-dupe) is unchanged; only the UI *location* of the management
  controls moved. No edge-fn, migration, or security-surface change.
